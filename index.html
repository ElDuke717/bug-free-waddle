          <h2>A Timeless Tradition</h2>
          <p>
            Tarot card reading is an ancient practice, rich with history and
            symbolism. Each card in the tarot deck holds specific meanings that,
            when combined, tell a unique story and provide perspective. Our
            seasoned readers interpret these stories to connect you with the
            timeless wisdom of the tarot.
          </p>

          <h2>Personalized Readings</h2>
          <p>
            We believe each tarot reading is a personal exploration. Choose from
            a variety of spreads and decks to suit your specific query or
            situation. Our readings are tailored to your energy and the
            questions you bring to the cards, ensuring a session that speaks
            directly to your spirit.
          </p>

          <h2>What to Expect</h2>
          <p>
            During a tarot reading, you will select cards from the deck, which
            our readers will lay out in a specific spread. Each position in the
            spread reflects a different aspect of your question. As the cards
            are revealed, we will guide you through their meanings and the
            insights they provide into your life's journey.
